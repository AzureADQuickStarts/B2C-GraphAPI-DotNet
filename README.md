# A Console application for Azure AD B2C User Management the Azure AD Graph

There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of [MSAL.NET](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet). Check it out:

* [Azure AD B2C user account management with .NET Core and Microsoft Graph](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-dotnetcore-b2c-account-management)

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the master branch, but please know that it's no longer maintained.
