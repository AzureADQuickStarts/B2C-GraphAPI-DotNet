# A Console application for Azure AD B2C User Management the Azure AD Graph
This sample demonstrates how to perform user management by calling the Azure AD Graph in an automated fashion. This aproach is similar to a service account scenario where the application acts as itself, not as a user that signed-in via an interactive user login. This is done by using the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant.

The application covered by this sample is a Windows command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to invoke various methods.

## Steps to Run
For detailed instructions on how to run this sample, checkout [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-graph-dotnet).

## Questions & Issues
Please file any questions or problems with the sample as a github issue.  You can also post on Stackoverflow with the tag `azure-ad-b2c`.
